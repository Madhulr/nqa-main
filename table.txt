Complete the Counsellor's Part
For the counsellor role, you want to enable:
View and access:
/enquiry-form (POST to /api/enquiries/)
/enquiry-list (GET from /api/enquiries/)
/demo-list (GET from /api/demo_lists/)
What we need to ensure:
Enquiry Form: Submits new enquiries to /api/enquiries/ (already set up).
Enquiry List: Fetches and displays data from /api/enquiries/ (mapping is now correct).
Demo List: Fetches data from /api/demo_lists/.
Sidebar: Only shows these three links for counsellors (already implemented).
Role-based API access: If you want to restrict API access on the backend,
 make sure your Django views check the user's role.
