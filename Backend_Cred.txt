Consider the backend and see the Page not found (404)
Request Method:	GET
Request URL:	http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Using the URLconf defined in student_enquiry.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:

admin/
api/
token/ [name='token_obtain_pair']
token/refresh/ [name='token_refresh']
token/verify/ [name='token_verify']
swagger/ [name='schema-swagger-ui']
redoc/ [name='schema-redoc']
The empty path didn't match any of these.

You're seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.  
  See what it has and i now need make backend for Frontend's (It  has many pages first 3 for counselors and next 2 are Account sections and next 3 are of HR 
  section where Last interview page is still not developed so lets leave and

I want a single table and different api's for respective pages and lets fix the data flow between them and consider the first Enquiryform data entered after
 submitting the data should come to the second page's field of what it has all the sections and keep remaning fields as null and can be Updatable with clicking 
 on Edit button and if the user clicks on Move button it will repeat the same like adds the previous student details table and 

-------------------------------------
. Backend
Ensure your Enquiry model has all fields needed for all steps, with null=True, blank=True for fields not required in the first step.
Use a ModelViewSet for /api/enquiries/ with GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
Add a status field to track progress (e.g., 'new', 'details', 'moved', etc.).
2. Frontend
Page 1: On submit, POST and redirect to Page 2 with the new ID.
Page 2: On mount, GET by ID, pre-fill, PATCH on submit, "Move" button triggers PATCH and redirect.
Page 3: Same as Page 2.
